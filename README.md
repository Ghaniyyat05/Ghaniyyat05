# Hey there! 👋

### 🌟 Who Am I?  
I'm **@Ghaniyyat**, your friendly neighborhood **Software Engineer**! I specialize in crafting high-quality, innovative software products. My superpowers include:
- **Full-Stack Development**: I can juggle both front-end and back-end like a circus performer—without dropping the ball!
- **Automated Testing**: I automate testing so that I can avoid the horror of doing it manually (who needs that kind of stress?).

### 🔧 What I’m Up To
I’m currently leveling up my skills in: 
- **Advanced Test Automation**: Working with **Playwright** and **Python**—because who doesn’t want to make testing more fun (and less tedious)?
- **Development Magic**: Enhancing my skills in **React** and **Node.js**.

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate!
I’m on the lookout for:
- **Open Source Projects**: Let’s join forces and create something epic together—preferably while wearing matching superhero capes.
- **Quality-Centric Projects**: If you’re into improving product standards and making users happy, I’m your gal!

### 📫 Reach Out 
I’d love to hear from you—seriously, I’m not that scary!

### 🌍 A Little Extra
- **Pronouns**: She/her
- **Fun Fact**: I’m a cultural explorer who loves trying new dishes. I also have a talent for making awkward jokes and puns (brace yourselves!). Just remember, I’m much more laid-back than I appear! 😊

Excited to connect, collaborate, and maybe even share a laugh or two!
